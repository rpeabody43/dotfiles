# ~/.dotfiles

Repo for hidden dot files in my home directory, such as .bashrc and .gitconfig

## TODO

- [Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_MpUP6aKiQ)
- Add files to the repo proper
- Set up symlinks for them:
  ```
  ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
  ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
  ```
- add a brewfile with stuff like VS Code, Chrome, and Git Bash
- Use this as an opportunity to learn bash as a language to automate this (test in a vm ig idfk)
  - That would be a fun project for very little benefit as I'm in high school and have just a pc and laptop
